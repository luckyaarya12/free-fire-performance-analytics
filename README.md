# Free Fire Performance Analytics

A data analysis project focused on understanding match-level performance trends in Free Fire using Python and Excel.

This project analyzes gameplay statistics such as kills, wins, K/D ratio, time played, and game modes to uncover performance patterns and overall insights.

## Tools & Technologies Used

Python  
Pandas  
NumPy  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  
Excel  

## Dataset

The dataset contains match-level Free Fire performance data stored in Excel format.

The dataset includes the following fields:

Date  
Game Mode  
Matches Played  
Wins  
Kills  
Deaths  
Headshots  
Damage  
Time Played (Hours)  
K/D Ratio  
Win Percentage  
Headshot Percentage  
Average Damage  

The dataset does not contain usernames, player IDs, or any personal information and is safe to include in this repository.

## Analysis Performed

The following analyses were performed using Python:

Time Played vs Kills to understand the relationship between playtime and performance  
Time Played vs Wins  
Distribution of K/D Ratio  
Mode-wise Average K/D Ratio  
Overall Average Performance Metrics  

All visualizations are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install Python (version 3.9 or above recommended)
2. Install required libraries using pip  
   pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
3. Place the Excel file inside the `Data` folder
4. Run the analysis script using the command:python analysis.py
